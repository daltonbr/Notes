# Notes

This is a compilation of my personal notes from various online courses.
I develop this habit of taking notes to improve my English writing skills and to have a place to look up when I need to recap something from previous courses.
Feel free to use these notes as you wish.  
Typos and any kind of corrections are welcomed.
