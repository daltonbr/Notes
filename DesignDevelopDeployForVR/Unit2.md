# Unit 2 - VR Game Dev and Prototyping

Summary
Ruth Bram, Producer at Oculus Studios and Mari Kyle, Content Launch Manager from the Oculus Store, team up to explore different approaches to ideation and prototyping to help set you up for success in this course. You’ll gain a solid understanding of how to strategically evaluate your VR game within each stage of VR game development and at each key milestone. You’ll learn how to identify your target audience, how to best position your title to consumers, and how to build a following. With the exercises and templates provided, you’ll create a game design document (GDD), a player profile report, and a press kit.

**Learning Objectives:**

* Walk through the stages of VR game development from concept to launch
* Gain insight into how to evaluate your VR game throughout each stage/milestone
* Start prototyping your game in VR
* Identify your target audience and how to position your VR title to these consumers
* Learn best practices for creating a GDD, a player profile report, and a press kit for the escape room vertical slice you will be building throughout this course

We break down the development into Pre-Production, Production, and Post-Production.

## Pre-Production

### Ideation

* Research Resources
* Art and Narrative References

**Mind Mapping** is a good technique to use in this stage.

**Exquisite corpse exercise** (for teams), each one draws in isolation a portion of a corpse, later to be revealed to everyone.

**Forced connection exercise* Randomly pair nouns or adjectives that might not naturally go together, and build around it, making connections.

Adjectives | Nouns
--- | ---
floating | Aquarium
dusty | Phonebooth
crawling | Desert
desolate | Palace

### Audience

Target Audience

In (2019) the VR Audiences are quite varied these days. Different devices pull different audiences.

**TLDR**: Rift customer almost always played apps that were interactive. So we need to make those interactions solid and fun.

#### Gamer Segments

In depth profiles on different types of gamers.

* Games they like to play
* why they play
* How long they play
* Their favorite genres
* How much they would spend
* Overall motivations to play

It could be worth to acquire some reports from specialized research companies to know our target audience.

**Exercise**

* What are some comparable escape room games?
* What are some comparable escape room games in VR?
  * What do they do well?
  * What do they do poorly?
  * What are they missing?

**Some references to start**:

* 'Shadow Point' by Coatsink
* mind-bending puzzle games like 'The Witness'

**Play a few related games**

Fill the **Ideal User Profile** (attached)

Imagine the perfect person who would be interested in the app and build around that person.
Besides all the basic profiles, we can think about what they would want from an experience, and what other media they consume that reflects these wants.
