# Unit 2 - VR Game Dev and Prototyping

Summary
Ruth Bram, Producer at Oculus Studios and Mari Kyle, Content Launch Manager from the Oculus Store, team up to explore different approaches to ideation and prototyping to help set you up for success in this course. You’ll gain a solid understanding of how to strategically evaluate your VR game within each stage of VR game development and at each key milestone. You’ll learn how to identify your target audience, how to best position your title to consumers, and how to build a following. With the exercises and templates provided, you’ll create a game design document (GDD), a player profile report, and a press kit.

**Learning Objectives:**

* Walk through the stages of VR game development from concept to launch
* Gain insight into how to evaluate your VR game throughout each stage/milestone
* Start prototyping your game in VR
* Identify your target audience and how to position your VR title to these consumers
* Learn best practices for creating a GDD, a player profile report, and a press kit for the escape room vertical slice you will be building throughout this course

We break down the development into Pre-Production, Production, and Post-Production.

## Pre-Production

### Ideation

* Research Resources
* Art and Narrative References

**Mind Mapping** is a good technique to use in this stage.

**Exquisite corpse exercise** (for teams), each one draws in isolation a portion of a corpse, later to be revealed to everyone.

**Forced connection exercise* Randomly pair nouns or adjectives that might not naturally go together, and build around it, making connections.

Adjectives | Nouns
--- | ---
floating | Aquarium
dusty | Phonebooth
crawling | Desert
desolate | Palace

### Audience

Target Audience

In (2019) the VR Audiences are quite varied these days. Different devices pull different audiences.

**TLDR**: Rift customer almost always played apps that were interactive. So we need to make those interactions solid and fun.

#### Gamer Segments

In depth profiles on different types of gamers.

* Games they like to play
* why they play
* How long they play
* Their favorite genres
* How much they would spend
* Overall motivations to play

It could be worth to acquire some reports from specialized research companies to know our target audience.

**Exercise**

* What are some comparable escape room games?
* What are some comparable escape room games in VR?
  * What do they do well?
  * What do they do poorly?
  * What are they missing?

**Some references to start**:

* 'Shadow Point' by Coatsink
* mind-bending puzzle games like 'The Witness'

**Play a few related games**

Fill the **Ideal User Profile** (attached)

Imagine the perfect person who would be interested in the app and build around that person.
Besides all the basic profiles, we can think about what they would want from an experience, and what other media they consume that reflects these wants.

### Defining Game Design and Features

Escape room vertical slice:

* What will the player be doing in your game?
* How will they do it?
* How does the player progress through the game?
* How is the narrative delivered?
  * Text, voiceover, thought bubbles.
* What type of transitions?

#### Some best practices

* Provide left-handers support
* Explain visually the controllers commands.
* Quest apps are more easy to walk around (when not wired)
* **Teleportation** is easy for everyone, but sometimes we leave that as a secondary option.
  * Which button will trigger the 'teleportation arch'?
  * Include an arrow that show the direction where the user will land
    * sometimes is interesting to let the user rotates that arrow, left stick is an option here
    * sometimes the direction could be 'locked', as a way to 'guide' the user.
  * Consider adding a fade to black between transitions.
  * Teleport speed option, which indicates how quickly the fade will be going when you move from A to B.
  * Being clearly upfront with the user is very important.

### Building a Game Design Document

There are some interesting material supplied with this course (check the Tutorial Material folder)

* What is the game about?
* What will it look like?
* What will it feel like?
* How will the user interact with the game?

* Game overview
* Unique selling points
* Gameplay scope (gameplay hours, number of levels, number of players supported, overall objects, and more)
* Map out game loops
* Target art style details
* Player profiler stories (personas)
* Milestone schedule (alpha, beta and master deliverables)
* Project vitals:
  * Development cycle
  * Team composition
  * Development costs

Marketing plan

* Will you be using primarily social media?
* Which platforms and how?
* Will you be targeting specific interest groups?
* Who and how do you plan on reaching them?

### Development and Prototyping

**Modular game development** is a method where you segment your game into sections that allow you to work on parts of it without interfering with the whole game.

Mechanics could be separated. Characters from narrative could be trimmed if they are not working.

Since VR provides fresh challenges to development, tackle early on the aspects of development that we foresee to have the biggest risks. Prototyping is a great way to prove out these risky aspects. It's also important to choose the some of the most prominent features to prototype first.

Prototype first the Unique Selling Points (USP).

Devs also sometimes consider prototyping arts, sounds and UI.

### Management Tools

* Unity Hub
* Version Control (GitHub, Perforce) 

## Production

### First Stages of Production

* First Playable
* Interim Builds
* Vertical Slice

#### First Playable

A bare-bones version of your game that features early versions of **core mechanics** and **affordances** that your player can navigate and interact with.

* Get the world scale correct.
* Check that the player isn't at a weird height.
* Test basic mechanics and core interactions.

#### Interim Builds

* Locomotion
* Comfort
* Interactions
* Art Style
* Scale

Intervally develop the game using feedback as a guide to establish your core mechanics and features.
The publisher could ask for weekly, biweekly or monthly interim builds, depending on the stage you're at in production.

#### Vertical Slice

A portion of your game which acts as a proof of concept for stakeholders to experience how the full game will look and feel.

* First vertical slice
  * Representative of character art and environmental art.
  * Demonstrate all core aspects of gameplay, including player movements and interactions.

* Second vertical slice
  * Take the feedbacks from the first one, iterate on that and update it (you may need to do that a few more times).
  * Your final vertical slice should be enough for the player to understand the game by itself, not relying on external guidance (you could use tutorials for instance). **'Show! Don't tell'** is a better option when possible.
  * Evaluate how these vertical slices are demonstrating your USP's.
  * When you have a solid vertical slice, you could start begin building press anticipation, and get feedback from other professionals.
  * Performance is extremely important to the perception of the game.
  * Recruit external testers to provide feedback on usability and learnability.

Benefits of working with a Publisher:

* Project funding
* QA
* External usability testing
* Producers

Keep working on the slice until we had a solid one. We may need to re-scope and tailor your development to any challenges that we face. Sometimes it's important to throw away some parts of the project that aren't working well, even if that means losing work.

### Final Stages of Production

* Alpha
* Beta
* Master build

#### Alpha

Definitions of an Alpha can vary per developer. Some developers prefer Alphas to be Feature Complete, while others prefer to only have 50% of features complete.

* Content complete
* Core mechanics complete
* Core features complete
* Quality assurance (QA) testing starts

#### Beta

* Content complete
* Feature complete
* Final core art
* Final mechanics
* Final gameplay
* Keep, testing a lot.

#### Master build

* Completed version of the game (almost finish and ready to be show to the public)
* If no launch blocking bugs come back from QA, we could use this build for launching.

## Post-Production

### Distribution, Publication, and Marketing

#### Submitting to Oculus Store

1. Stage 1 - Application Stage
Fill out information about your game for submission to the Oculus Store.
2. Stage 2 - Technical review
Game is reviewed for technical issues such as performance issues or bugs.
3. Stage 3 - Content review
Game is reviewed to see whether or not it meets the content guidelines.
4. Stage 4 - Publishing review
Assets are checked to make sure they will look good on the Oculus Store.

This process can take up to two weeks, and the app can be sent back with feedback and suggestions at any point.

#### Marketing

* Maintaining your game
* Bringing it to your audience

Beautiful and good games could fail on strategy marketing. It's possible to not reach the target audience, not enough people, or misled the audience.

##### Press kits

* Art assets
* In-game screenshots
* Announcements
* Gameplay trailers

Also comprises **One-sheets**

* Price
* Gaming platform
* Release date
* Website links
* Game description
* Unique selling points
* Logos
* Company bio
* Why you built this game for VR?

**IMPORTANT** make GIF's - bite-sized videos that highlight your USP's and interesting mechanics.

##### Social media

Start early on, and build your community throughout development.
Grab and hold social media handles that are relevant to your game.

After release the game and have grown your player base and community, you can push out on game news outlets to promote and raise awareness. Keep in mind your target audience.

Attend VR events, physical and digital ones.
Do your target audience watch livestreams, let's plays or listen to podcasts?

Discord servers could be interesting to have a more personal contact with the fans, and help manage your livestream followers. Beta builds for the top fans.
