/*:
 # The SWITCH Statement
 ---
 
 ## Topic Essentials
 At its most basic, a switch statement takes a value and runs it against possible matching patterns that we define in code. Each possible match can have a different block of code that will be executed if matched to the value being switched on. 
 
 ### Objectives
 + Create variables for **firstInitial**, **hp**, and **mp** and assign them values
 + Use a switch statement to execute different code for different **firstInitial** values
 + Use a switch statement with number ranges to execute different code based on **hp**'s value
 + Use a switch statement to evaluate multiple variables, and for one case bind those values to local variables and use the `where` keyword to define the case pattern
