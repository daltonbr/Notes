 # Type safety and inference

 ## Topic Essentials
 Swift is a **type safe** language. When you assign an initial value to a variable the Swift compiler will infer its type without you having to specify it. If you need an empty variable with no initial value, you will need to use a type annotation to let the compiler know what value type to expect later on.
 
 ### Objectives
 + Declare a variable with an initial value and no type annotation
 + Declare a variable with a type annotation and no initial value
 + Create a variable with a type annotation and an initial value
 + Create multiple variables of the same type with a single type annotation
