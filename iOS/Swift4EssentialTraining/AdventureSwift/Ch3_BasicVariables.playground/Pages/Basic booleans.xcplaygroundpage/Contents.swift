 # Basic booleans

 ## Topic Essentials
 Booleans are declared with the `Bool` keyword, and are very handy for setting up flags and logic checks. They follow the same type inference rules as other types, so you can declare them with initial values or without depending on your needs
 
 ### Objectives
 + Create a boolean called **characterIsRunning** and set it to `false`
 + Change the boolean to `true`
 + Use the bang operator to change the boolean value to its opposite
