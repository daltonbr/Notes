 # Swift Arrays

 ## Topic Essentials
 Swift arrays work like **ordered lists**, meaning that the position of each element is determined by the order it was added. Arrays also work off of indexes, meaning that each element in an array has a corresponding index value that you can use to access it.
 
 In Swift, arrays are zero-indexed, so the first item is stored at index 0.
 
 ### Objectives
 + Create empty arrays with different syntax
 + Create an array called **levelDifficulties** with initial values
 + Use the `count` and `isEmpty` methods
 + Iterate over **levelDifficulties** and print out its indexes and values
