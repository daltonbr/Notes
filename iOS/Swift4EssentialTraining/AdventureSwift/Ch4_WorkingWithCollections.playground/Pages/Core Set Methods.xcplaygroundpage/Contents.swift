 # Core Set Methods

 ## Topic Essentials
 Because sets only store unique values, there are a number of useful operations you can perform on them without having to reinvent the sorting/filtering wheel. These include the `intersection` and difference of set values, as well as `union` and `subtraction`. 
 
 ### Objectives
 + Copy and paste the **allQuests** set from the previous page
 + Create a new set called **completedQuests** and assign it a subset of quests from **allQuests**
 + Try out the different operations the `Set` class can perform
