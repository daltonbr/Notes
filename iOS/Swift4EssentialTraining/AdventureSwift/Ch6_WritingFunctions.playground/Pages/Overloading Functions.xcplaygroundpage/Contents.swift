 # Overloading Functions
 ---
 
 ## Topic Essentials
 Swift 4 allows us to have multiple functions with the same name as long as their function type, or signature, is different. This is called overloading a function, and is very useful in cases when you may need constant functionality, but with different inputs and outputs.
 
 ### Objectives
 + Create a base function called **attack** with no parameters or return values
 + Create an overloaded function of **attack** with an integer parameter
 + Create another overloaded function of **attack** with two parameters and a return type
