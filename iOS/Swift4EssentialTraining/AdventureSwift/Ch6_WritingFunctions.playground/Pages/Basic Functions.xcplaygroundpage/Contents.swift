 ## Topic Essentials
 Functions are blocks of code that we can define and call by name to perform whatever tasks weâ€™ve coded into them. Functions can have parameters, which you can think of as inputs, and return values, which you can think of as output.
 
 ### Objectives

 + Create a function called **findNearestFriend** with a return type and have it return a string
 + Create a function called **equipItems** with a parameter and return type
