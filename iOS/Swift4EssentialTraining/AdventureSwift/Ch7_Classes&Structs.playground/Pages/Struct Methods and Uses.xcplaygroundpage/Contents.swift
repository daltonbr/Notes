 # Struct Methods and Uses
 ---
 
 ## Topic Essentials
 Structs can have instance and type methods just like classes. However, they do not support inheritance so they cannot be chained together like super and sub classes.
 
 ### Objectives
 + Recreate a simple **Level** struct with a string array instance property called **objectives**
 + Write a function to print out all level objectives
 + Use a mutating function to remove completed objectives
