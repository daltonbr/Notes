 ## Topic Essentials
 A great way to add functionality to your classes is to give them their own methods. Like properties, you can create both instance and type methods for any class.
 
 ### Objectives
 + Create a simple version of our **Adventurer** class
 + Add an instance and a type method
 + Create a new class called **Ranger** as a subclass of **Adventurer**
 + Set up its designated initializer and override the parent class's instance method
